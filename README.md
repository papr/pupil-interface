# Pupil Interface
Python module which uses `Pupil Sync` to remote control `Pupil` software.

**Note:** Pupil [v0.8](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/releases/tag/v0.8) introduces a new communication pattern (see [IPC Backbone](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/wiki/Pupil-Interprocess-and-Network-Communication)). `Pupil Interface` is being rewritten to work with the IPC Backbone. A stable version without time synchronization can be found in the branch [`ipc-version`](https://github.com/papr/Pupil-Research-Plugin-Suite/tree/ipc-version). It will be merged into `master` as soon time sync is implemented.
